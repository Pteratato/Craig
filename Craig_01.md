 # *Craig!*
### *01: The Novel*

*My name is Craig Doyle and I’m writing a ground-breaking novel.*

My alarm chirrups with the song of a thousand meadow katydids promptly at 5:00am, and I groggily bumble out of bed. I splash water on my face as those katydids seem to sing *‘wake up, Craig!’* and *‘don’t be late, Craig!’*

I’m never late; I need to be prompt so I can work on my novel. I smile in the mirror, the expression pulling up my round face. I’m not a young man anymore, and I’m not as thin as I used to be, but these things don’t bother me much these days. I’m just me, Craig Doyle, one ordinary bug in a world crawling with ordinary bugs.

Maybe one day I’ll do something decidedly unordinary.

I brew a single serving of coffee and mix up a bowl of oatmeal with raisins and cream; the Craig standard issue breakfast. Next I pick out my suit for the day, which will probably be taupe, or maybe sandalwood, and if I’m feeling confident it might even have pinstriping.

Today feels like a pinstriping kind of day.

I can tell it’s going to be a lucky sort of day, so I pull on my favorite socks for good measure. They’re pineapple argyle with green accents, and stitched little ants marching along the pattern lines. They were a stocking stuffer from Madison many Christmases ago, and they have a bit of magic to them. I feel bolder when I wear that pineapple argyle.

I head out the door 4.5 minutes earlier than usual, and this is another lucky sign.

My house is one of those squished, downtown kind of houses, which are more tall than wide and have no measurable yard. The neighbors on either side are pressed up to it like pedestrians crammed into a subway at rush hour. It’s not as nice as the house I had before the… *incident*... but it’s close to work, and that’s nice. I can just walk there, and I like that.

On the walk I find 2 pennies, 1 quarter, and a brand-new silver pen, which looks very similar to the one I lost last week.

*Finding lost items – definitely lucky.*

As my destination comes into view, my pace slows. I turn the corner from *Doris Avenue* onto *Canary Street* and there it is, a great, gaping maw of a building.

The *Lansig County Press*.

The LCP is an old, brick behemoth, most of it empty these days as people transition from print media to digital, but the Canary Street face of the LCP has been repaired recently and looks respectable, even inviting. The words *Lansig County Press* are displayed boldly in black, serifed typeface against the red brick, and the front-facing windows are kept immaculately clean, the bushes cropped into submission. This side of the LCP is colloquially referred to as ‘street-side’, and holds the offices and client rooms and all of the amenities of upper management.

The back end of the building is called ‘lot-side’ because of the parking lots nestled up against it, and there’s far less incentive to keep lot-side respectable. That’s where the printing presses are located, along with the warehouse and other manufacturing sections. That’s where I work as the Printing Press Manger, 1st Shift.

The LCP doesn’t run a 3rd shift, so not a single soul is in the building at this time of morning, and that’s how I like it best.

I unlock the lot-side door and huff up the stairs to my third floor office, which sports a plaque with the following text in *Times New Roman*:

*Craig Doyle*</br>
*Printing Press Shift Manager*

I take a breather here to catch my breath, then I unlock the office door and switch on the light. I put my things away, start a small pot of coffee, and begin my morning rounds; a series of daily chores, consisting of (in this order): </br>
</br>

1)  Check on the various terrariums situated around the room – Barbara the African millipede; Jose, Manuel, and Riccardo, hissing cockroaches from South America; the alluring Delilah, *hymanopus corantus*; and two cobalt blue tarantulas called Itchy and Scratchy. Armed with a notebook of record-keeping, I jot down the temperature, humidity, and state of each enclosure.

2) Feed, if applicable; it was not a feeding day for the predator arthropods, but Barbara and the triplets will appreciate some lettuce.

3) Move Delilah to the window terrarium. She likes the morning sunlight there better.

4) Check on *The Farm.* </br>
</br>

The center of the office hosts the real *pièce de résistance*, a *Nebula 360* glass formicarium the size of a dinner table, complete with a 4-sided view of my 3,000 strong ant colony. It has all the features: water tower, gravity well, removable glass panes…

But my favorite part of *the Farm* is the above-ground section, still encased in glass but painted with tiny models from life. There’s a barn, complete with plastic farm animals and a toy tractor on one side. A long, curving dirt path from the farm leads to a crude city, featuring a 3D printed model of the *LCP* made as a cake topper for a company celebration. The rest of the buildings and little people are made of cardboard and paper, because the ants prefer that.

*Check on the Farm* is the last item on the tasklist because I like to sit and watch it for a while. It makes me nostalgic; some of the cardboard houses and people were crafted by Madison years ago, back when it was still cool to have projects with dad and we assembled our first formicarium together. She cut the figures out of magazines and pasted them on cardboard, and they’re forever frozen mid-stride boasting their Gucci bags and designer dresses for the ants. All of them have purple, curling mustaches drawn on them in marker. 

I like how the people in the city go about their lives, oblivious to the massive ant colony around and beneath them. It’s like a secret world no one wants to see. When people come into my office, the Farm makes them uncomfortable. I like this, too, a little bit.

I don’t meditate over the Farm very long today because I have more important things to do. It’s finally time, the part of the day I anticipate the most; that glorious moment I first sit down at my desk. I place my coffee at my left, my scratchpad at my right, and I relish the click and hum of the computer powering on. Still almost two hours before the shift starts, two hours before staff arrive, two hours with just me and my ground-breaking novel.

I stare.

I stare at the nearly blank document displayed on my computer screen, where the following words are typed:

*My name is Craig Doyle and I’m writing a ground-breaking novel.*

I tap my pen rhythmically on the desk. I scribble some notes – can’t forget that meeting after lunch about the school board editorial – and I sip coffee. 

And then something strange happens.

Eerily, as if some fae were playing tricks on me, the clock chimes 9am. 

I jump at the unexpected sound, thinking the clock must be wrong, until I hear the doors below open and admit dozens of employees clocking in for the day. The shouting starts, the printing presses whir to life, and the clock just tick-tick-ticks.

*Tick-tick-tick.*

When people ask me what I’m working on – and they frequently don’t – I usually reply that it’s a ground-breaking novel about insects. If they inquire further – which they never do – I tell them it’s a nonfiction novel, because insects teach people about life.

The truth is that I don’t know what my novel is about, because I haven’t written it yet. But they always say to “write what you know”, and insects are what I know. I think it’s safe to assume it will be about insects, then.

Did you know the number of different insect species is believed to be between six and ten million, but we’ve only discovered one million? Sometimes I think once we’ve discovered the other five-to-nine million, we’ll understand a lot more about life.

I once wrote a short story about a click beetle for a column in the *Tri-County Registar*, something I was very proud of at the time. This beetle didn’t know he was a beetle, but he occasionally had the sense of being infinitesimally small and insignificant, which would occur to him at random times, and then pass. He lived in a stretch of woodland by a highway, and he would often ponder the lights that streaked by at unfathomable speeds, white and then red. The click beetle was so small that he couldn’t perceive what created the phenomenon, only the lights that sliced through the night and then vanished. He pondered these things, but there were no answers. So one night, he violates the natural law of avoiding the unknown and travels into the road to touch that light. The click beetle dies in the grille of a vehicle, euphoric. 

I wrote this but I don’t know exactly what it means, and I love that.

I showed this story to Madison after it was published, and she was somewhat alarmed and concerned. She said she didn’t know I wrote that kind of thing. I told her, neither did I. I asked her if she thought I could one day write a novel. She paused for a long time, and then said, “I dunno, Dad. This style is peculiar; you use too many periods. Your sentences are short. It’s like staccato, there’s no rhythm.”

I laughed and told her maybe my brain is staccato.

Here is what a typical work day in the life of Craig Doyle, Printing Press Shift Manager, looks like:

First, I answer no less than 16 emails complaining about the spelling of the *Tri-Couny Registar*, our main newspaper publication. I politely explain that while I understand their frustrations, this spelling was an intentional decision by the publications board because they couldn’t decide between *Tri-County Registrar* and *Tri-County Star*.  I answer 7 calls about this same issue and assure the complainants that, yes, I would petition to have it changed. I make the long walk to the street-side section of the LCP to file the complaints in the suggestions box. No one reads them, but I feel the nagging sense of an incomplete task if I don’t file them properly, so I do it anyway.

Afterwards I attend the morning meeting with the rest of the management, quality, and office teams at the LCP. Dr. Kadner, our plant manager, asks a lot of questions that he already knows the answer to and then takes turns berating the staff for being behind schedule, despite being the reason for most of the delays. Then we discuss upcoming orders, events, and the hottest new manufacturing processes imported from Japan, which will undoubtedly be tedious and incompatible with the American workforce. Once I spent three weeks coming up with my own manufacturing process, which I titled *Isoptera Homosapius* because I utilized the impressive eusocial behaviors of termites to design a team structure that promotes a sense of camaraderie and efficiency among the colony. I thought something as instinctive as the native compulsions of social arthropods would be more dependable and effective within the American workforce than the strict disciplinarian techniques of the Japanese. 

Plan *Isoptera Homosapius* did not go over well in the company meeting, however.

Next I typically do a quick lap around the floor, checking on the presses and team members and making sure all of the publications are an acceptable level of behind schedule. I assist the employees on the floor with any needs, collect training documents, and conduct general managerial tasks. Then I pick up my lunch and head back to my office.

Unless there’s something happening on the floor that requires my assistance, I usually spend the rest of my shift in my office, typing up reports, forwarding calls, and responding to more emails complaining about the name of the *Registar*.

Today, however, is a bit different. I can feel it in my cilia as I approach the manufacturing floor of the LCP, making the rounds after the morning meeting. It’s too quiet. One of the presses isn't running properly.

Sure enough, the sports printer for the *Tri-County Registar* is at a standstill, a beached whale of industrial machinery. To make matters worse, I spy *Carla* perched on top of the press, smacking one of the conveyor belt rollers with a wrench. I feel a cold, clammy sweat prickle at the back of my neck.

Carla is like a big, round, mean *armadillidium vulgare* – a pillbug if I ever saw one. Normally you’d think of pillbugs as those nice little rolly-pollies you’d befriend as a kid, curling them up into little balls and letting them wander over your hand, but not Carla. Carla always gives me the clammies. 

“Hey, Carla!” I shout in my firmest supervisory voice. “Y-y-you can’t be up there!”

She lifts her head and stares down at me with her beady little eyes. “Hey, bossman!” she shouts over the din of the other presses. “Now don’t you worry your pretty little mustache – I got this covered, ain’t no big deal!”

Several other employees are watching now, waiting to see what happens next.

*Okay, Craig, you can do this. She’s just a pillbug. No one’s afraid of a pillbug.*

“Uhhh, yes, C-Carla, I’m sure you d-do but…. Article five-point-three, p-paragraph two in the *Operator’s Guide to Safety* c-clearly states that only a registered–”

I fumble it. I can feel it. I’m looking at my hands, gesturing. I’m wiping my forehead and adjusting my glasses. It’s no use.

I *am* afraid of pillbugs.

“Bossman, bossman, bossman,” Carla starts in again. “This damn printer been down twenty minutes already and Jake ain’t here. Who’s gonna fix it? You gonna go tell Kadner to call in second shift? Gonna be two hours at best.”

I can feel the perspiration slid down my temple – shipping would be delayed. I’d have to stay late again. Dr. Kadner would be livid.

“Kadner’s gonna tear you a new one…” Carla continues, shaking her head sadly. “I’m jus’ watchin’ out for my fav bossman, keepin’ you off the hook.”

People are watching. I can’t just wilt beneath Carla’s beady stare. I exhale, I steel myself up. I straighten my posture. I look up at the pillbug violating every manufacturing safety standard on top of that printing press.

“Carla,” I say firmly, pointing. “P-put on your safety glasses.”

Carla smiles and salutes. “You got it, Bossman.”

7pm and I’m making yet another trudging assent up the stairs to my office. The last one for this shift, I hope.

Carla didn’t get the printing press fixed; in fact, she dropped her wrench and it wedged between the support bars inside the press. Jake had to be called in. Shipping was missed. Dr. Kadner was livid.

Remembering Dr. Kadner’s face with his bulging eyes and the veins popping out of his neck gives me the clammies all over again.

Stephen Walberg, the second shift manager, has yet to show up for work.

My stomach growls; someone stole my lunch from the company fridge today. Did they eat it? I hope they did, otherwise what a waste of good pimento.

I half-heartedly perform the evening rounds, checking on everyone and moving Delilah back to her overnight cage. I glance at my phone, but there’s still no word from Steven Walberg. I sigh, shuffle over to my desk, and slump into my swivel chair, exhausted. It squeaks commiseratingly. I slouch there a moment, staring at my desktop, trying to decide the best way to kill time while waiting for second shift.

Something strange happens now, the inverse mischief from this morning. As I stare at my desk, time slows down. I can see the events of today spread out like frames from a movie, and these same frames repeat over and over, stretching out in both directions, filling my past and promising my future. Middle managers don’t write ground-breaking novels. 

I was wrong about it being a lucky, pinstriping kind of day.

I sigh deeply, feeling depressed. Maybe Janet is right, and being a punching bag for upper management *is* my only talent. I take off my glass and put my head down on my desk with a light ‘thunk’. 

*Oh God...* </br>
*Great Hivekeeper to us all...* </br>
*I don’t ask for much but...* </br>
*Help me write my ground-breaking novel…* </br>
*Please show me what to do…* </br>
*Or a sign…* </br>
*Anything at all…* </br>

My phone rings suddenly and it’s Steven Walberg, saying he’ll be here soon. I sigh again and straighten up, but I do feel a little better. I scroll through my inbox one last time. All just the same messages… the same boring stuff…

Spam...

Work notifications...

Complaints about the *Registar*…

More spam…

Suddenly I stop, my attention snagged by the headline **‘Are You PRAYING For A CHANGE?’** Eerily, I glance around the office as if someone might be there, but there was no one. I look back to the screen and notice this title:

**‘Do YOU have the courage to UNLOCK your POTENTIAL?’**

I don’t consider myself courageous but…. what if… what if this is the sign?

**‘Are YOU looking to radically change YOUR life?’**

I look around the office again to make doubly-sure no one’s watching. And then I do the thing I never thought I would do. I do the thing no one should *ever* do, but I’m a desperate soul, and desperation can drive men to do unthinkable things.

I click on that spam email.
