 # *Craig!*
### *04: Harold Booker*

Insects make much more sense than humans.

With insects, you know what to expect. There are good aspects and bad aspects, but when you encounter an insect you have a pretty solid idea of how that creature will behave.

Things are not so transparent with humans. We project all kinds of things with our bodies, our clothes, our mannerisms, expressions, and words, and yet those projections may not accurately represent the human underneath. I think this is called *cognitive dissonance*.

Sometimes I think humans have evolved a bit too much, and now we’re stuck in a chaotic state of conflicting mechanisms and thoughts. Like we should’ve stopped evolving a couple of millennia ago but we kept right on going, ignorant of how we’re setting ourselves up for failure and unhappiness.

Once in a while I dream I’m a June beetle, and life is much simpler. A June beetle acts according to its nature and doesn’t wonder much about that. It eats and reproduces and tries to live peaceably.

But I admit, you can’t write a ground-breaking novel about eating and reproducing and living peaceably; at least not one for humans.

That’s why I’m standing on this porch outside of an unfamiliar duplex, the chilly night air making my arm hairs prickle beneath the layers of clothes. The door on the left side of the duplex sports a tie-dyed peace symbol hanging by a nail and a large *Calypso* sign overhead. The door on the right side has nothing, but on the windowsill next to it there’s an old beer can with a miniature American flag on a stick poking out of it like a red-white-and-blue daisy.

Behind the door on the right, I hear a deep groaning from inside.

I’m afraid of wheel bugs, and afraid of getting into trouble with the law for stalking one, but if I see on the news tomorrow that an elderly wheel bug died at 1867 Barker Street, I’ll feel much worse. So I gather my courage and knock gingerly on the door, calling, “H-hello?”

No answer. I turn the knob and, finding it unlocked, slowly push the door open. I peak my head inside, my mustache twitching at the musty odor.

The interior is dim, dusty, and spartan, even by the meager standards of bachelorhood, but my gaze is immediately pulled to a wooden staircase leading upwards. At the bottom of the stairs is a crumpled heap of a bug, his legs all tangled and a laceration at his temple oozing dark blood. The crate of green juice is smashed all over the stairs, some bottles still lazily rolling away from the scene.

“H-hey! Are you okay?”

I rush over to him, forgetting all about potential trespassing charges, and start checking him over. He’s obviously a little dazed, fading in and out of consciousness, and the side of his head is swelling into a sizable lump. The laceration is continuing to bleed profusely, obscuring his face with the sticky liquid. Even in the darkness I recoil at the sight of it.

“I’ll call an ambulance,” I gasp, reaching for my cellphone.

“No!” the old man barks, startling us both with his rapid jerk to awareness. “No.”

“B-but, sir!”

“Listen, I don’t know who the hell you think you are barging into my house like this, but if you wanna play good Samaritan get me a danged towel.”

I hesitate for a second, then shuffle off down the hall obligingly. As I move further from the intimidating wheel bug and the scattered bottles of green juice, my fatherly instincts kick with a sense of urgency. I find a small bathroom under the stairs and rummage around inside, grabbing two towels and a first aid kit. I tuck this under my arm and head into the kitchen to see if I can find an ice pack.

“What’re ya doin’ in my house, anyway?” the old man shouts from the hallway.

“Uhh–” I use the rest of my time in the kitchen to quickly gather up my thoughts.

“I, uhh, I heard you fall…” I return to the hall to find the wheel bug sitting up on the bottom step, feeling around his left knee for any damage. The side of his face is covered in blood, his short, salt-and-pepper hair matted with it, but he seems nonchalant. “I’m a friend of Colt’s…”

The man snorts.

“Must not be a very good’un. Any friend of Colt’s ‘ould know he’s at the subway on weekends.”

I pass the old man a towel and put the other supplies next to him, but I can’t help but glance at the bottles of green juice all over the floor. This certainly wasn’t the type of caper I was expecting… 

And now that it appears the old man isn’t in any immediate danger, my curiosity temporarily overpowers my good sense.

“Why did you steal Colt’s green juice?” I blurt out suddenly, surprising both of us.

“*Steal?!*” The wheel bug flares up wildly on his wobbly legs, energized by rage and indignation. He throws his bloodied towel on the ground and rounds on me, causing me to throw my hands up in a gesture of defenselessness as he pokes a bony finger at my chest. 

“That pot-smoking hippie is the one who stole the green juice!” he rages. “Where do ya think he’s getting ‘is ‘awl natural organic Kale and secret ingredients’, it ain’t in his own garden that’s for dang sure!”

My heart is hammering in my chest, but the old man pivots back to the stairs and kicks the first aid kit ferociously in his anger, and by now his temple is bleeding more than ever. 

“Get out of my house!”

Stunned by the outrage, I stumble back and turn to leave, perspiration beading on my forehead. I pause at the front door with one hand on the knob, the other wiping the sweat from my bald head. I feel a pang of guilt for offending the old man, and I watch his hunched back in the dim light for a moment as he fumbles around for the scattered first aid supplies. I take several quick, hyperventilating breaths to calm my nerves and steel my resolve, then turn to face him again.

“Sir! With due respect, I-I,” I falter slightly but press on. “I-I-I don’t think you should be alone. Page 45 line 37 of the *Workplace Guide to Safety* states that even a minor knock on the head could be concussive, and if you insist on not going to the doctor, you should be monitored for the next several hours for the following symptoms: A - Persistent or worsening headache. B - vomiting. C - blood or clear fluid coming from the nose or ears. D - Memory loss or confusions. E - mood changes or irritability – sir, are you normally this irritable?”

The man turns and stares at me as if I’ve grown a second head, one spindly arm lifted to keep pressure on the wound. Suddenly, his face cracks and he breaks into an uproarious laughter. He doubles over and clutches his stomach, his thin frame shaking. Even in the drab grayness of the hallway, I can see the color return to his cheeks and tears leak from the corner of his eyes.

“Alright, alright,” he says breathlessly once he’s able. “What’s yer name, kid?”

I stand up tall, mildly indignant at being called ‘kid’. “Craig Doyle.”

“I’m Jet. C’mon, then. You want coffee, tea, whiskey? If yer gonna be in my house, might as well have a drink.”

The warm, yellow glow from Jet’s old lamps does much to improve the atmosphere of the apartment, and I find myself quickly relaxing in the old man’s presence. I’m amazed at myself for all of this; I’ve never done anything like this before, meeting random people and staying in their homes and holding my ground. Normally I’d back off, wilt, retreat, just wanting to live peaceably like a June beetle. But I was bold enough to come this far, and I don’t want to jeopardize that now.

Maybe I make my own pinstriping sort of day.

I learn that Jet’s real name is Harold Booker, and he’s a Vietnam War veteran and a military enthusiast. His apartment is saturated with war memorabilia; photos of soldiers and locations, foreign landscapes, souvenirs, and old coins in picture frames with labels like ‘Filipino piso 50c’ and ‘50 sen 1870’. There’s a standard-issue rifle hanging on the wall in the sitting room next to a helmet painted jungle green. Issues of TIME magazine covering the war are scattered over the coffee table, trapped in a bygone era.

We don’t chat much at first. Jet cleans up and applies a medical patch to his head, grumpily refusing all assistance. Then he puts on a kettle and starts up a fire in the small hearth. Sometimes I venture to ask him this or that question under the guise of making sure he doesn’t have a concussion, but he mostly replies in a series of grunts and huffs. He's even narrower without his duster, tall but thin, his back arched in the trademark hump of a wheel bug.

We sit down in the den with our mugs, mine filled with herbal tea and his with instant coffee and a splash of whiskey. I don’t think it’s wise to drink alcohol after a knock on the head like that, but I keep this to myself. It must be almost midnight by this point, but the intense events have shaken off any tiredness I might’ve otherwise felt.

As we settle into our respective leather armchairs, Jet asks me how I know Colt Hertzwin. This catches me off guard, and I realize I don’t know how to answer. I’m honest as a general rule; lying can be complicated, and too hard to remember. But the truth is that I really don’t know Colt Hertwin, and saying as much would expose the untruth I had told earlier.

“W-well–” I glance at my lap and smooth out my trouser leg, my mustache twitching as I search for the right words. Colt stares at me, uncannily still and rigid. He doesn’t even blink as he waits for my answer, and I feel the clammies bead up under my collar.

“...Colt said he would change my life,” I finish finally, and this is true.

“Change yer life?” Jet repeats. “Oh wait- wait- let me guess – yer one of them ‘zombies’ he’s always bangin’ on about, that right?”

“Well… yes, I guess so. See, I’m writing this book…”

Jet laughs in disbelief. It isn’t a mocking laugh, but I’m not sure what it means so I just smile a little.

“That Colt changin’ lives!?” He guffaws with glee. “Can’t change your life with pot and Led Zepplin, Kid – that ain’t real change. *I’ll* change yer life.”

I’m taken aback by this proposition. Two people want to help me change my life? “Y-you will?”

“Just drop me behind a curtain and call me the *Wizard of Oz*!” Jet continues. “So what d’ya want? Money? A nice wife? A *spine*, maybe?”

My eyebrows raise, then furrow. I cup the tea in both hands and sip it thoughtfully. I’m not sure how to articulate what I want. I’m not sure anyone has ever asked me. I’m not sure *I’ve* ever asked me.

I have to think about this for a moment.

“Stories,” I answer finally, this time with conviction. “I want stories.”

Jet smiles. “Well, I’d say you’ve come to the right place. Help me out with a couple o’ tasks, and I’ll make sure you get some of the best stories.” 

I ponder this. I think about Colt Hertzwin, who responded to my emails and might be looking for me in the subway right now. He seemed like a magical sort of fellow, dancing around with his trumpet, peddling life-changing potions to dull, sleepy workers.

And I think about Jet, the grumpy veteran who has probably traveled the world, seeing things most people would never see – and would never want to see. And he probably knows things about human beings, about life, that most would never want to know. 

And I spy, underneath a table, bottles of green juice, most of them with no label. Some of them do have labels, but not the white Calypso label. It’s a khaki camouflage type of label with gold stars, and I can see it says *‘ROTORHEAD’* and *‘High Octane Energy’*. I find this is all very confusing.

I look back at Jet, who is now rolling up a cigarette with loose-leaf tobacco, allowing me the space to come up with my answer.
